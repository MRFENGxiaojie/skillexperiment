### Test Case Writing

**DO:**
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Include expected results for every step
- Test one thing per test case
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep test cases maintainable

**DON'T:**
- Assume knowledge
- Make test cases too long
- Skip pre-conditions
- Forget edge cases
- Leave expected results vague

### Bug Reporting

**DO:**
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include screenshots/videos
- Specify exact environment details
- Describe impact on users
- Link to Figma for UI bugs

**DON'T:**
- Report without reproduction steps
- Use vague descriptions
- Skip environment details
- Forget to assign priority
- Duplicate existing bugs

### Regression Testing

**DO:**
- Automate repetitive tests when possible
- Maintain regression suite regularly
- Prioritize critical paths
- Run smoke tests frequently
- Update suite after each release

**DON'T:**
- Skip regression before releases
- Let suite become outdated
- Test everything every time
- Ignore failed regression tests
