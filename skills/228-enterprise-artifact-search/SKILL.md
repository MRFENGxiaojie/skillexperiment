name: enterprise-artifact-search
description: Multi-hop evidence search + structured extraction over enterprise artifact datasets (docs/chats/meetings/PRs/URLs). Strong disambiguation to prevent cross-product leakage; returns JSON-ready entities plus evidence pointers. Use when the user asks questions whose answers must be retrieved from enterprise documents, chat logs, meeting transcripts, PRs, or URLs, needs structured entity extraction with evidence pointers, or wants multi-hop evidence gathering without loading large files into context.

## Interaction policy

Work autonomously by default: do not proactively ask the user questions, request confirmation, or ask for choices. Only interact when the task explicitly requires it, or when essential information genuinely cannot be obtained from the provided materials/tools; otherwise decide and proceed from available evidence.

# Enterprise Artifact Search Skill

This skill delegates **multi-hop artifact retrieval + structured entity extraction** to a lightweight subagent, keeping the main agent’s context lean.

It is designed for datasets where a workspace contains many interlinked artifacts (documents, chat logs, meeting transcripts, PRs, URLs) plus reference metadata (employee/customer directories).

Two rules carry the most weight: **product grounding** (a candidate artifact must prove it belongs to the target product before it counts) and **evidence-based reviewer extraction** (meeting participation alone is never enough — the transcript or reviewer fields have to show the contribution).

---

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke when ANY of the following is true:

1. The question requires **multi-hop** evidence gathering (artifact → references → other artifacts).
2. The answer must be **retrieved** from artifacts (IDs/names/dates/roles), not inferred.
3. Evidence is scattered across multiple artifact types (docs + slack + meetings + PRs + URLs).
4. You need **precise pointers** (doc_id/message_id/meeting_id/pr_id) to justify outputs.
5. You must keep context lean and avoid loading large files into context.

---

## Why Use This Skill?

**Without this skill:** you manually grep many files, risk missing cross-links, and often accept the first “looks right” report (common failure: wrong product).

**With this skill:** a subagent:
- locates candidate artifacts fast
- follows references across channels/meetings/docs/PRs
- extracts structured entities (employee IDs, doc IDs)
- **verifies product scope** to reject distractors
- returns a compact evidence map with artifact pointers

The subagent returns only extracted entities plus evidence pointers, so the main agent's context stays lean.

---

## Invocation

Use this format:

```python
Task(subagent_type="enterprise-artifact-search", prompt="""
Dataset root: /root/DATA
Question: <paste the question verbatim>

Output requirements:
- Return JSON-ready extracted entities (employee IDs, doc IDs, etc.).
- Provide evidence pointers: artifact_id(s) + short supporting snippets.

Constraints:
- Prefer primary artifacts (docs/chat/meetings/PRs/URLs) over metadata-only shortcuts.
- MUST enforce product grounding: only accept artifacts proven to be about the target product.
""")
```

If the environment does not provide an `enterprise-artifact-search` subagent, attach this skill's Core Procedure as the Task prompt and delegate the search execution that way — the main agent should not run the search steps itself.

---

## Core Procedure (Must Follow)

### Step 0 — Parse intent + target product
- Extract:
  - target product name (e.g., “CoachForce”)
  - entity types needed (e.g., author employee IDs, key reviewer employee IDs)
  - artifact types likely relevant (“Market Research Report”, docs, review threads)

If product name is missing in question, infer cautiously from nearby context ONLY if explicitly supported by artifacts; otherwise mark AMBIGUOUS.

---

### Step 1 — Build candidate set (wide recall, then filter)
Search in this order:
1) Product artifact file(s): `<Dataset root>/products/<Product>.json` if exists.
2) Global sweep (if needed): other product files and docs that mention the product name.
3) Within found channels/meetings: follow doc links (e.g., `/archives/docs/<doc_id>`), referenced meeting chats, PR mentions.

Collect all candidates matching:
- type/document_type/title contains “Market Research Report” (case-insensitive)
- OR doc links/slack text contains “Market Research Report”
- OR meeting transcripts tagged document_type “Market Research Report”

---

### Step 2 — HARD Product Grounding (Anti-distractor gate)
A candidate report is **VALID** only if it passes **at least 2 independent grounding signals**: signals must come from distinct sources (container location, document content, channel/meeting series, id path) — two signals derived from the same artifact path count as one.

**Grounding signals (choose any 2+):**
A) Located under the correct product artifact container (e.g., inside `products/CoachForce.json` *and* associated with that product’s planning channels/meetings).
B) Document content/title explicitly mentions the target product name (“CoachForce”) or a canonical alias list you derive from artifacts.
C) Shared in a channel whose name is clearly for the target product (e.g., `planning-CoachForce`, `#coachforce-*`) OR a product-specific meeting series (e.g., `CoachForce_planning_*`).
D) The document id/link path contains a product-specific identifier consistent with the target product (not another product).
E) A meeting transcript discussing the report includes the target product context in the meeting title/series/channel reference.

**Reject rule (very important):**
- If the report content repeatedly names a different product (e.g., “CoFoAIX”) and lacks CoachForce grounding → mark as DISTRACTOR and discard, even if it is found in the same file or near similar wording.

**Why:** Different products can hold the same document type in the same or similarly named locations, and “first hit wins” is a common failure.

---

### Step 3 — Select the correct report version
If multiple VALID reports exist, choose the “final/latest” by this precedence:

1) Explicit “latest” marker (id/title/link contains `latest`, or most recent date field)
2) Explicit “final” marker
3) Otherwise, pick the most recent by `date` field
4) If dates missing, choose the one most frequently referenced in follow-up discussions (slack replies/meeting chats)

Keep the selected report’s doc_id and link as the anchor.

---

### Step 4 — Extract author(s)
Extract authors in this priority order:
1) Document fields: `author`, `authors`, `created_by`, `owner`
2) PR fields if the report is introduced via PR: `author`, `created_by`
3) Slack: the user who posted “Here is the report…” message (only if it clearly links to the report doc_id and is product-grounded)

Normalize into **employee IDs**:
- If already an `eid_*`, keep it.
- If only a name appears, resolve via employee directory metadata (name → employee_id) but only after you have product-grounded evidence.

---

### Step 5 — Extract key reviewers (DO NOT equate “participants” with reviewers)
Key reviewers must be **evidence-based contributors**, not simply attendees.

Use this priority order:

**Tier 1 (best): explicit reviewer fields**
- Document fields: `reviewers`, `key_reviewers`, `approvers`, `requested_reviewers`
- PR fields: `reviewers`, `approvers`, `requested_reviewers`

**Tier 2: explicit feedback authors**
- Document `feedback` sections that attribute feedback to specific people/IDs
- Meeting transcripts where turns are attributable to people AND those people provide concrete suggestions/edits

**Tier 3: slack thread replies to the report-share message**
- Only include users who reply with substantive feedback/suggestions/questions tied to the report.
- Exclude:
  - the author (unless question explicitly wants them included as reviewer too)
  - pure acknowledgements (“looks good”, “thanks”) unless no other reviewers exist

**Critical rule:**
- Meeting `participants` list alone is NOT sufficient.
  - Only count someone as a key reviewer if the transcript shows they contributed feedback
  - OR they appear in explicit reviewer fields.

If the review meeting is the designated review venue, your evidence must cite the transcript lines/turns that contain the reviewers' suggestions.

---

### Step 6 — Validate IDs & de-duplicate
- All outputs must be valid employee IDs (pattern `eid_...`) and exist in the employee directory if provided.
- Remove duplicates while preserving order:
  1) authors first
  2) key reviewers next

---

## Output Format (Strict, JSON-ready)

Return:

### 1) Final Answer Object
```json
{
  "target_product": "<ProductName>",
  "report_doc_id": "<doc_id>",
  "author_employee_ids": ["eid_..."],
  "key_reviewer_employee_ids": ["eid_..."],
  "all_employee_ids_union": ["eid_..."],
  "recommendation": "USE_EVIDENCE | NEED_MORE_SEARCH | AMBIGUOUS"
}
```

### 2) Evidence Map (pointers + minimal snippets)
For each extracted ID, include:
- artifact type + artifact id (doc_id / meeting_id / slack_message_id / pr_id)
- a short snippet that directly supports the mapping

Example evidence record:
```json
{
  "employee_id": "eid_xxx",
  "role": "key_reviewer",
  "evidence": [
    {
      "artifact_type": "meeting_transcript",
      "artifact_id": "CoachForce_planning_2",
      "snippet": "…Alex: We should add a section comparing CoachForce to competitor X…"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Recommendation Types

Return one of:
- **USE_EVIDENCE** — evidence sufficient and product-grounded
- **NEED_MORE_SEARCH** — missing reviewer signals; must expand search (PRs, slack replies, other meetings)
- **AMBIGUOUS** — conflicting product signals or multiple equally valid reports

---

## Common Failure Modes (This skill prevents them)

1) **Cross-product leakage**  
Picking “Market Research Report” for another product (e.g., CoFoAIX) because it appears first.  
→ Fixed by Step 2 (2-signal product grounding).

2) **Over-inclusive reviewers**  
Treating all meeting participants as reviewers.  
→ Fixed by Step 5 (evidence-based reviewer definition).

3) **Wrong version**  
Choosing draft over final/latest.  
→ Fixed by Step 3.

4) **Schema mismatch**  
Returning a flat list when the caller expects separate fields.  
→ Fixed by Output Format.

---

## Example

Question:  
“Find employee IDs of the authors and key reviewers of the Market Research Report for the CoachForce product?”

Correct behavior:
- Reject any report whose content/links are clearly about CoFoAIX unless it also passes 2+ CoachForce grounding signals.
- Select CoachForce’s final/latest report.
- Author from doc field `author`.
- Key reviewers from explicit `reviewers/key_reviewers` if present; else from transcript turns or slack replies showing concrete feedback.

---

## Do NOT Invoke When

- The answer is in a single small known file and location with no cross-references.
- The task is a trivial one-hop lookup and product scope is unambiguous.
- The task is to write or summarize the report itself, or to analyze documents that need human reading judgment.
- The answer requires knowledge outside the dataset.

This skill returns grounded evidence and a recommendation type; drawing conclusions beyond that is the caller's job.
